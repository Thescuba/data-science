# Introduction to Data Science
I've been machine learning for couple of years now and learning never seems to stop! Often I when I face a topic that I am unfamiliar with I like to try to understand the concept at the atomic level. To do this I like to break the problem to its most basic level then try to construct it back together but with unit test on the way. I get the concept down then see if my code matches, and if not i figure out why. While this has worked well for me in the past I find that why I see a topic that I had not study in a year I usually have to go through the learning processes again. To me, learning occurs when one is able to make a connection with the concepts being taught. For a while I had just broken the problem down piece by piece it was easy to understand each sub problem, but I never really spend much time thinking about the project as a whole. To try to solve this problem I have decided to document my learning and have it easily accessable to everyone.

# Notebooks Installation

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks to follow along with the lectures. However, there are several
packages and applications that need to be installed. It is recommended to install anaconda at (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Alternatively you may just want to go with just a python 3 install and use pip to install numpy, matplotlib, pandas nad jupyterlab or notebook.

## Install git

Follow the instructions at (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)


## Run Notebooks


1. Clone the repository to a desired location (E.g. `git clone https://github.com/Thescuba/data-science.git`)
2. Open up jupyter labs or jupyter notebook either though anaconda navigator or terminal. 
3. Go to the repository directory
